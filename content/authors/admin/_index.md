Holding the belief that the human beings and machines are co-envolving into a more advanced life form, Jipeng Sun founded Sharing Idea, an academic organization conducting bold research on both sides: enhancing human beings with machines, and enchancing machines with human intelligence.

To enhance human beings with machines, Jipeng Sun focuses on two areas: revolutionary human-machine interaction technologies and online education. Technologies like brain-machine interface, augenmented reality, and e-learning system will be the next-generation computing tools to liberate human's hands, enrich human's eyes, and strengthen human's brain.

Human intelligence is also inspiring for machines at this time. Besides the popular AI research directions such as NLP and CV, Jipeng Sun spends his time more on brain-inspired intelligence research. His research includes spiking neuron network, cognitive robotics, and machine reasoning. These research will enable machines with embodied experience, a truely crucial point for machines to obtain artificial general intelligence.
